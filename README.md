NX Baskerville
======================

NX Baskerville is a font family based on Libre Baskerville. It adds a bold
italic style and makes some other minor tweaks. The original Libre Baskerville
was designed by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida, and New Baskerville
is maintained by Daniel Benjamin Miller.

The fonts, when used with TeX or the like, are probably best at around 85%
of their nominal size for body text.

The family is made available under the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1:
see `COPYING` for details.
